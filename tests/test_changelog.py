<!--
Release notes will be parsed and available as /release-notes
The parser extracts for each version:
  - a short description (first paragraph after the version header)
  - bullet entries beginning with "- " under that version (across any subsections)
Internal builds may append content to the Unreleased section.
Only write entries that are worth mentioning to users.
